## Notebooks Included 

### 1. `Sentiment Analysis.ipynb` and 'Quantivative Analysis'

This is the primary notebook for developing and evaluating our sentiment analysis model. It covers:

* **Data Loading:** How financial news headlines and associated labels are loaded.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration of the dataset, including sentiment distribution, text length analysis, and identifying potential data issues. 
* **Sentiment Over Time Analysis:** Visualizing how news sentiment evolves over different periods.
* **Price Data Exploration:** Analyzing price trends, volatility, and key financial indicators.

### 2. `Correlation.ipynb` (Coming Soon!)

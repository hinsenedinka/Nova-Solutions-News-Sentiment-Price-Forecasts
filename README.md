# Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines for Price Forecasting

---

## Overview

Welcome to the "Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines for Price Forecasting" project! This initiative delves into the fascinating intersection of financial news and market movements. Our core objective is to **analyze the sentiment expressed in financial news headlines** and investigate its potential correlation with asset price changes. By understanding how positive, negative, or neutral news influences investor perception, we aim to uncover insights that could eventually contribute to more informed price forecasting strategies.

## Features

This project comes equipped with a suite of capabilities designed to tackle the complexities of news sentiment and its market impact:

* **News Headline Collection:** Tools and methodologies for gathering pertinent financial news headlines. 
* **Robust Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including various machine learning models, to accurately classify news headlines into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.
* **Quantitative Sentiment Scoring:** Each headline is assigned a numerical sentiment score, allowing for precise measurement and comparison.
* **Seamless Price Data Integration:** Incorporates historical asset price data, enabling direct correlation analysis between sentiment and market performance.
* **In-depth Correlation Analysis:** Explores the statistical relationships between our calculated sentiment scores and actual price movements, helping to identify potential leading or lagging indicators.
* **Experimental Price Forecasting:** Investigates the feasibility of integrating sentiment as a valuable feature within predictive models for future price changes.

## Installation

Getting this project up and running is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the project to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Nova-Solutions-News-Sentiment-Price-Forecasts.git](https://github.com/your-username/Nova-Solutions-News-Sentiment-Price-Forecasts.git)
    cd Nova-Solutions-News-Sentiment-Price-Forecasts
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    To manage dependencies effectively and avoid conflicts with other Python projects, creating a virtual environment is highly recommended:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    Before installing dependencies, activate your newly created virtual environment:

    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If you encounter any issues with `scikit-learn` specifically, you can try installing it directly:
    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can dive into the heart of the project. We recommend following the workflow outlined in our Jupyter notebooks:

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    While a dedicated script (`scripts/data_collection.py`) will handle the automated gathering of news headlines and historical price data, ensure you have your raw data prepared or use the provided dummy data for initial exploration.

2.  **Sentiment Analysis:**
    Navigate to the `notebook/Sentiment Analysis.ipynb` file. This notebook is your guide to understanding the sentiment model development, text preprocessing, model training, and sentiment classification processes.

    To open Jupyter Lab and access the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

3.  **Correlation and Forecasting:**
    Future notebooks (to be added to the `notebook/` directory) will guide you through the intricate steps of correlating sentiment scores with price movements and experimenting with various price forecasting models.
